### Abstract (for arXiv metadata):

This paper presents ICAR (Intelligent Concept-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a novel methodology that extends traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems through intelligent concept extraction and multi-level matching strategies. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation shows 96% overall performance enhancement, 89% improvement in relevance accuracy, and 49% better source document identification compared to baseline RAG implementations.
