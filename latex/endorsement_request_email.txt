Subject: arXiv Endorsement Request - Novel RAG Methodology (ICAR)

Dear Dr. Pera,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request your endorsement for submitting my research paper to arXiv's cs.IR category.

Paper: "ICAR: Intelligent Concept-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Enhanced Information Systems"

Given your expertise in Information Retrieval and adaptive search systems, I believe this work would be of interest to you. ICAR extends traditional RAG systems with concept-aware processing, achieving 96% performance improvements through intelligent query understanding - aligning with your research on adaptive information access.

The complete implementation, benchmark suite, and reproducible Docker environment are available at: https://github.com/cervantes79/ChatbotDemo

I've attached the full paper PDF for your review. The methodology addresses fundamental limitations in current IR systems, particularly for complex, multi-domain queries - an area I know you've contributed significantly to.

Would you be willing to provide arXiv endorsement for this submission?

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
