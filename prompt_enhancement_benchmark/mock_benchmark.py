## Conclusion

{conclusion}

### Next Steps
1. **Real API Testing**: Validate these results with actual OpenAI API calls
2. **Methodology Refinement**: Based on results, consider adjusting concept extraction
3. **Academic Publication**: If real-world results confirm these findings
4. **Production Implementation**: Consider integrating successful techniques

### Limitations
- This benchmark uses simulated responses for cost-effective testing
- Real LLM behavior may differ from mock responses
- Results should be validated with actual API testing

---

**Note**: This is a simulated benchmark for methodology validation.
Real-world performance may vary with actual LLM responses.
