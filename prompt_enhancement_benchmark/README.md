# Prompt Enhancement Benchmark

## Objective
Compare the effectiveness of ICAR concept-enhanced prompts vs. normal prompts without RAG retrieval.

## Test Methodology
- **Control Group**: Normal prompts sent directly to LLM
- **Test Group**: Prompts enhanced with ICAR concept extraction
- **Sample Size**: 100+ test cases across multiple categories
- **Metrics**: Response quality, relevance, concept understanding, consistency

```

## Test Categories
1. **Business Queries** (25 tests)
2. **Technical Questions** (25 tests)
3. **Weather Requests** (20 tests)
4. **General Knowledge** (15 tests)
5. **Complex Reasoning** (15 tests)

## Success Criteria
If concept-enhanced prompts show significant improvement in:
- Response relevance (>15% improvement)
- Concept understanding (>20% improvement)
- Overall quality score (>10% improvement)

Then we proceed with academic paper and LinkedIn publication.
